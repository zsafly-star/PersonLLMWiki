"""
Thin wrapper around fastembed for lazy model loading and text embedding.

The embedding model is loaded once per process (singleton). If the configured
model name changes mid-process, the singleton reloads automatically.
fastembed is an optional dependency; calling encode() when it is not installed
raises ImportError with an actionable install hint.

Note: _get_model is not thread-safe. This is intentional — FastMCP uses
asyncio with a single thread for STDIO transport, so concurrent access cannot
occur in normal operation.
