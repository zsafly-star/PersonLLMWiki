"""Corpus resolution and warm orchestration for multi-document tools.

Pure-logic module (no MCP dependency). ``resolve_corpus`` turns a
directory or explicit path list into a validated file list;
``warm_docs`` (Task 2) runs the budgeted warm loop that extracts text
(and optionally embeddings) into the existing per-doc cache. All
SQLite writes go through the ``PDFCache`` instance passed in by the
caller; this module owns no storage of its own.

    Each inner list is one document's (doc_path, page) hits, best first.
    Every item appears in exactly one list, so the fused score is
    1 / (k + rank): items interleave by within-document rank.

    That leaves every document's rank-1 page tied at 1/(k+0), and the
    tie covers the whole top of the ranking whenever many documents
    match. `scores` breaks those ties by relevance -- pass the per-page
    BM25 relevance from the per-document search, higher meaning better.
    Without it the tie falls to (doc_path, page), i.e. alphabetical
    order, which carries no relevance at all: a query matching 98 of 100
    documents returned the 10 alphabetically-first ones and scored 0.000
    doc-NDCG, and the same degeneracy silently inflated the stage-2
    spike's spread class, whose labelled documents sorted early.

    BM25 here is computed per document, so scores are not calibrated
    across documents the way a corpus-wide index would calibrate them.
    They are still a real signal -- a document where the query terms are
    rare scores above one where they are boilerplate -- and any relevance
    signal beats sorting by filename. Ranking quality is measured by the
    `described` class in `benchmark_data/corpus_search`.

    (doc_path, page) so the result stays deterministic.
